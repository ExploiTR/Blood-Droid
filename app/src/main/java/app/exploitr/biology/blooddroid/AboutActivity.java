        String main = "In the 19th century, blood transfusions were a very risky undertaking.Patients could of course survive the procedure, but the number of deaths was extremely high. For this reason, blood transfusions were only carried out in cases of extreme loss of blood, if there were no other possibilities to save the life of the patient. In 1900, Austrian scientist Karl Landsteiner discovered the reason for the high number of deaths. There are namely different blood groups and when mixed, the red blood cells could clump together. Landsteiner received the Nobel prize in 1930 for Physiology and Medicine. By taking a sample of blood from donor and recipient before a transfusion and comparing the blood groups, blood transfusions became a lifesaving procedure.";

        String contribution1 = "Karl Landsteiner(June 14, 1868 – June 26, 1943), was an Austrian biologist and physician and immunologist.He distinguished the main blood groups in 1900, having developed the modern system of classification of blood groups from his identification of the presence of agglutinins in the blood, and identified, with Alexander S. Wiener, the Rhesus factor, in 1937, thus enabling physicians to transfuse blood without endangering the patient's life. With Constantin Levaditi and Erwin Popper, he discovered the polio virus in 1909. He received the Aronson Prize in 1926. In 1930, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He was posthumously awarded the Lasker Award in 1946, and has been described as the father of transfusion medicine.";
