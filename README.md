# Example :
## If both parents have type A blood, then their alleles could be iAiA or iAiO for both parents.

### So the chances are:

Alleles iAiA is (9÷16)×100 % = 56.25%

Alleles iAiO is (6÷16)×100 % = 18.75%

Alleles iOiA is (6÷16)×100 % = 18.75%

Alleles iOiO is (1÷16)×100 % = 06.25%

#### Since iAiA, iAiO and iOiA are blood type A, and iOiO is blood type O, thus their child has 93.75% chance to be blood type A and 6.25% chance to be blood type O.
